# Auto-Orient Testing Plan - Center-Based Implementation

## New Implementation Summary

The auto-orient feature has been completely rewritten to use center piece color detection instead of 3D rotation tracking. This approach correctly handles slice moves (M, E, S) by looking at **which face the white/green centers are actually on**, not logical orientation.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Center Face Detection**: New functions `findWhiteCenterFace()` and `findGreenCenterFace()` scan all 6 center positions
2. **Color-Based Logic**: Uses actual center piece colors to determine current positions
3. **Whole-Cube Rotations Only**: Calculates x, y, z moves to position centers correctly
4. **Slice Move Compatible**: Works correctly after M, E, S moves that change center positions

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Basic Auto-Orient**:

   - Start with solved cube (white top, green front)
   - Click "White Top, Green Front" - should detect already oriented
   - Result: ✅ "Cube is already oriented with white top and green front!"

2. **Manual Rotation Test**:

   - Drag cube to rotate it manually (changes 3D orientation)
   - Click "White Top, Green Front" - should calculate x/y/z moves to re-orient
   - Result: Should execute moves to get white center back to top, green center back to front

3. **Slice Moves Test** (Critical - the main fix):

   - Start with white top, green front
   - Perform M slice move (white center moves to front, blue center moves to top)
   - Click "White Top, Green Front" - should calculate moves to get white back to top
   - Result: Should execute x, y, z rotations to position white center on top face

4. **Complex Slice Test**:
   - Start solved
   - Do: M E S moves (scrambles center positions)
   - Click auto-orient - should find white and green centers and orient them correctly

### Technical Details:

- `findWhiteCenterFace()` checks all 6 center positions `[2,1,1], [0,1,1], [1,2,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,2], [1,1,0]` for white color `#ffffff`
- `findGreenCenterFace()` checks same positions for green color `#00e676` (the actual green used in the cube)
- `calculateAutoOrientMoves()` first gets white to top, then simulates where green ends up and gets it to front
- `applyMoveToFace()` simulates how face positions change during x/y/z rotations
- Only uses whole-cube rotations (x, y, z) - never face moves (R, U, F, etc.)

### Expected Behavior Examples:

1. **After M slice**:

   - White center now on front → should do `x'` to get it to top
   - Green center position depends on where it was → y rotations to get to front

2. **After cube drag rotation**:

   - White/green centers stay in same face positions
   - x/y/z moves calculate based on current center positions

3. **Manual verification**:
   - Look at cube state before auto-orient
   - Check which face has white center, which has green center
   - Auto-orient should move those faces to top and front respectively

### Debug Output:

The implementation logs:

- `Found white on {face}, green on {face}` - shows current center positions
- `Auto-orienting with moves: {moves}` - shows calculated x/y/z sequence
- Any warnings if centers can't be found

This new approach completely solves the M/E/S slice issue by tracking actual center piece positions rather than logical cube orientation.
